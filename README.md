# DataModellingProject
Created a website for online music store consists around 45,000 music items where the customers can buy them through the site. I have used MS Access for storing my data and performed SQL queries on the available data. I have also used Microsoft Visio and Umbrello softwareâ€™s to create the Entity relationship diagrams for my project.
